# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Below you will find a list of guidelines to follow when making a contribution.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Major Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`. (This step can be skipped if you have already forked before)
2. If you've added any new code that should be tested, please do add tests.
3. If you've changed/modified any APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints. Refer to this link for more infomation on linting: https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/what-lint-code-and-why-linting-important
6. Issue a new pull request for reviewing and merging.
7. You're all done! :)
